This project was our Object Orientated Programmings final project for the first semester in second year.

It uses inheritance to allow for the creation of two sub classes, TV and Phone, from their super class Product.
It as a database to store these products.
A test class is used to ensure all methods and classes function correctly.
A user friendly menu was then created allowing the user to add a product, search for a product, 
display all products in the product database, order a product by creating a new customer and order 
and then print all details of the orders
